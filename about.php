        The simple idea of a string of clues conducive to their successors leading to the final puzzle is central to the competition, making it sophisticated and enjoyable. The players are usually given textual and/or visual questions in the game. The player cracks the picture/text to get an answer to the question using the Internet and hints, which will take her/him to the next question. The one who solves the last question first wins the game.</p>
